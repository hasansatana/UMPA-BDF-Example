# UMPA_BDF Example
 Includes .mex files for the UMPA_BDF Receiver and CCM, UCM metric
 
 It is an Ungerboeck Type Message Passing Algorithm for an example NOMA uplink Multiple Access MIMO Channels
 Run with the MUSA codewords but SCMA is also OK 
 
 You can change the parameters 
 N --> Number of antennas in receiver
 K --> Number of users 
 M --> QAM constellation size
 L_c --> Channel length
