###########Introduction#####
 This is the main BER/AIR calculation code for an examplary MIMO NOMA uplink transmission in long dispersive channels with single carrier modulations. 
*You can select the receiver type MMSE-SIC or UMPA-BDF or combination of them.
*You can also arrange a receiver to obtain single user matched filter performance of the receiver for a given uplink NOMA scenerio
*Code domain NOMA schemes which are SCMA and MUSA can be selected for the  simulations. 
*AIR calculations are based on Generalized Mututal Information concept
*For the simulations along with the BER/AIR with SNR,  BER/AIR vs Loading curves can also be obtained where loading is number of users over code length  (GMI). 
*Receivers are given in .mex format. whose copyrights are belong to authors
